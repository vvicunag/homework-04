# homework-04

I decided to design a world trivia quiz, so the grader can see something more fresh, rather than a repeated code quiz.

The answers rotate atomatically in function of their index in the respective array. 

The questions and answer cards update with each selection of an alternative, so the quiz proceeds accordingly. 


The quiz features a timer, which also substracts seconds for wrong answers. The quiz features a score tracker that will also access local storage at the end of the game in order to reproduce the value along with the user's name. 

The quiz restarts automatially without the need for refreshing the page. 



A capture of the homework can be found in the assets/images folder.
